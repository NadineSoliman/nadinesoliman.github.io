    abstract = {We append two additional black hole (BH) accretion models, namely viscous disc and gravitational torque-driven accretion, into the Numerical Investigation of a Hundred Astrophysical Objects (NIHAO) project of galaxy simulations. We show that these accretion models, characterized by a weaker dependence on the BH mass compared to the commonly used Bondi-Hoyle accretion, naturally create a common evolutionary track (co-existence) between the mass of the BH and the stellar mass of the galaxy, even without any direct coupling via feedback (FB). While FB is indeed required to control the final BH and stellar mass of the galaxies, our results suggest that FB might not be the leading driver of the cosmic co-evolution between these two quantities; in these models, co-evolution is simply determined by the shared central gas supply. Conversely, simulations using Bondi-Hoyle accretion show a two-step evolution, with an early growth of stellar mass followed by exponential growth of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). Our results show that the modelling of BH accretion (sometimes overlooked) is an extremely important part of BH evolution and can improve our understanding of how scaling relations emerge and evolve, and whether SMBH and stellar mass co-exist or co-evolve through cosmic time.},

    abstract = {Partial dust obscuration in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) has been proposed as a potential explanation for some cases of AGN variability. The dust–gas mixture present in AGN tori is accelerated by radiation pressure, leading to the launching of an AGN wind. Dust under these conditions has been shown to be unstable to a generic class of fast-growing resonant drag instabilities (RDIs). In this work, we present the first numerical simulations of radiation-driven outflows that explicitly include dust dynamics in conditions resembling AGN winds. We investigate the implications of RDIs on the torus morphology, AGN variability, and the ability of radiation to effectively launch a wind. We find that the RDIs rapidly develop, reaching saturation at times much shorter than the global time-scales of the outflows, resulting in the formation of filamentary structure on box-size scales with strong dust clumping and super-Alfvénic velocity dispersions. The instabilities lead to fluctuations in dust opacity and gas column density of 10–20  per cent when integrated along mock observed lines of sight to the quasar accretion disc. These fluctuations occur over year to decade time-scales and exhibit a red-noise power spectrum commonly observed for AGNs. Additionally, we find that the radiation effectively couples with the dust–gas mixture, launching highly supersonic winds that entrain 70–90  per cent of the gas, with a factor of ≲3 photon momentum loss relative to the predicted multiple-scattering momentum loading rate. Therefore, our findings suggest that RDIs play an important role in driving the clumpy nature of AGN tori and generating AGN variability consistent with observations.},
